  Manage your Sentry projects with sentry-cli: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/

  The SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable must be set to authenticate with Sentry. Also set the
  SENTRY_ORG environment variable if you don't want to configure each command separately.

  The Sentry project slug can be configured using the SENTRY_PROJECT environment variable.
