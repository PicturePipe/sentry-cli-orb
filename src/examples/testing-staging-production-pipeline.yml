description: >
  Example workflow for continuous delivery pipeline using testing, staging and production
  environments. Each environment uses a matching Sentry environment.

  Each push to the develop branch triggers a testing deployment with a Sentry release using the Git
  revision as version. Commits and deployment are also tracked by Sentry for this version.

  Each push to the master branch first triggers a staging deployment with a Sentry release using
  the Git tag as version. The same version is used for the manual production deployment. Commits
  and deployments are also tracked by Sentry for this version.
