  Manage your Sentry projects with sentry-cli. The SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable must be
  set to authenticate with Sentry. Also set the $SENTRY_ORG environment variable if you don't want
  to configure each command separately. The Sentry project slug can be configured using the
  $SENTRY_PROJECT environment variable.

    description: >
      Example workflow for continuous delivery pipeline using testing, staging and production
      environments. Each environment uses a matching Sentry environment.

      Each push to the develop branch triggers a testing deployment with a Sentry release using the
      Git revision as version. Commits and deployment are also tracked by Sentry for this version.

      Each push to the master branch first triggers a staging deployment with a Sentry release
      using the Git tag as version. The same version is used for the manual production deployment.
      Commits and deployments are also tracked by Sentry for this version.
